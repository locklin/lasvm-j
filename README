Fork of Professor Leon Bottou's "lasvm" implementation of Stochastic
gradient descent online learning.

I may modify this to do conformal prediction if it's not already 
in there, but this is mostly for a J and possibly an R port.

I took them (and the build options) from the LGPL Lush sources, but 
they can also be found here for use as a shared library.

Lush (which is excellent) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lush/files/lush2/

I think you need to drop the -march=nocona and maybe some of the 
other optimizations if you're not building on Intel64.
